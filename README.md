# Emotional-Analysis

Multi-class sentiment analysis problem to classify texts into five emotion categories: joy, sadness, anger, fear, love , surprise. A fun weekend project to go through different text classification techniques. This includes dataset preparation, traditional machine learning with scikit-learn, LSTM neural networks and transfer learning using BERT (tensorflow keras).

Sentiment & Emotional Analysis have applications in a diverse set of real-world problems such as stock market predictions, disaster management systems, health management systems, feedback systems for an organization or individual user to take an informed decision. In any business, it is important to know how customers truly feel about your services and products, because that is what really makes the difference. Sales figures, surveys, social media posts, ratings may help us get a general idea about customer views but it does not provide the finer, granular insights regarding what goes unsaid. This is where emotion & sentiment analysis comes in handy.

Emotion Classification & Emotion Intensity Prediction are separate but closely related tasks. Multi-task learning framework targets to achieve generalization by leveraging the inter-relatedness of multiple problems/tasks.I worked on the framework proposed in the research paper – “All-in-One: Emotion, Sentiment and Intensity Prediction using a Multi-task Ensemble Framework”. I rebuilt the model to examine & compare performance of multi-tasking framework and single tasking framework on emotion classification & emotion intensity predictions tasks.
